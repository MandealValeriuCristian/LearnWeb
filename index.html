        <h1 id="contry-name">Kingdom of Denmark</h1>
        <p id="paragraph">Denmark, country occupying the peninsula of Jutland (Jylland), which extends northward from the centre of continental western Europe, and an archipelago of more than 400 islands to the east of the peninsula. Jutland makes up more than two-thirds of the country’s total land area; at its northern tip is the island of Vendsyssel-Thy (1,809 square miles [4,685 square km]), separated from the mainland by the Lim Fjord. The largest of the country’s islands are Zealand (Sjælland; 2,715 square miles [7,031 square km]), Vendsyssel-Thy, and Funen (Fyn; 1,152 square miles [2,984 square km]). Along with Norway and Sweden, Denmark is a part of the northern European region known as Scandinavia. The country’s capital, Copenhagen (København), is located primarily on Zealand; the second largest city, Århus, is the major urban centre of Jutland.</p>
        <p  id="paragraph">Denmark covers an area of 42,916 km², making it slightly larger than the Netherlands, or slightly less than twice the size of the US state of Massachusetts.
            The country has a population of 5.7 million people (in 2016). Capital and largest city is Copenhagen. Spoken languages are Danish and some German. English is the predominant second language. Faroese is spoken in the Faroe Islands, Greenlandic in Greenland, as mentioned, both dependencies of the kingdom.
